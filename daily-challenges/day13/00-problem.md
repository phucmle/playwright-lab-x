## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, you need to write a function to count how many prime numbers are in that array. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

## Requirements

Write a JavaScript function named `countPrimes` to count the number of prime numbers in an array of numbers.

- If the array is empty, return 0.

## Knowledge

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Common prime numbers include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

Example:

- 2 is a prime number because it is divisible only by 1 and 2.
- 4 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1, 2, and 4.

## Examples

**Input:** `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`  
**Output:** `"Number of prime numbers: 4"`

**Input:** `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`  
**Output:** `"Number of prime numbers: 0"`
