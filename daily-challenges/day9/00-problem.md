# JavaScript

## Problem:

Displaying the current date is a common requirement in applications. In this exercise, you will write a function to get the current date and display it in the dd/mm/yyyy format.

### Requirements:

- Write a JavaScript function named `getCurrentDate` to get the current date and format it as `dd/mm/yyyy`.
- The function should return the current day, month, and year, ensuring that the day and month always have 2 digits (e.g., day 1 should be displayed as 01).

## Examples:

**Output 1**:
Output (with current date as September 14, 2024):
"Current date is: 14/09/2024"

**Output 2**:
Another output (with current date as January 5, 2024):
"Current date is: 05/01/2024"
