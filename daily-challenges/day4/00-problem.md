## Problem:

Manage a product list using Objects.

In this exercise, you will create a product list management system using objects. Each product will have a name and price, and you will write functions to add products, remove products, and calculate the total value of all products in the list.

### Requirements:

1. Create an object `productList` to store the product list.
2. Write a function `addProduct(name, price)` to add a product to the list. The product will have attributes `name` (name) and `price` (price).
3. Write a function `removeProduct(name)` to remove a product from the list by product name.
4. Write a function `calculateTotal()` to calculate the total price of all products in the list.

## Example:

**Input**:

- Add product: `"Apple"`, price: `5000`
- Add product: `"Banana"`, price: `3000`
- Remove product: `"Banana"`
- Calculate total product value.

**Output**:

- Products in the list: `Apple: 5000`
- Total product value: `5000`

**Explanation**:

- First, add the product `"Apple"` with a price of `5000`, then add `"Banana"` with a price of `3000`.
- Then, remove `"Banana"` from the list.
- Finally, calculate the total price of the remaining products in the list.
