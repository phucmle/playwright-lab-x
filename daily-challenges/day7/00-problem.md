# Javascript
## Problem:
The number of words in a sentence is the total number of words separated by spaces. In this exercise, you will write a function to count the number of words in a string entered by the user. A word is defined as any string of characters without spaces.

### Requirements:
- Write a JavaScript function named `countWords` to count the number of words in a text string.
- The function will take a string as input and return the number of words in that string.
- The string may contain punctuation marks such as periods, commas, or exclamation points, but only count words based on the spaces that separate them.

## Examples:
**Input 1**:
```javascript
"Hello, I am a programmer."
```

**Output 1**:
```javascript
"Number of words: 5"
```

**Input 2**:
```javascript
"JavaScript is very interesting!"
```

**Output 2**:
```javascript
"Number of words: 4"
```

**Input 3**:
```javascript
"      "
```

**Output 3**:
```javascript
"Number of words: 0"
```
