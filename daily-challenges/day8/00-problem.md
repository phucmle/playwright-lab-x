# JavaScript
## Problem:
Given an array of integers, you need to calculate the sum of all elements in that array. In this exercise, you will write a function to perform the calculation of the sum of numbers in the array.

### Requirements:
- Write a JavaScript function named `sumArray` to calculate the sum of numbers in the array.
- If the array is empty, return the message `"Empty array"`.
- If the array contains values that are not numbers, skip those values.

## Examples:
**Input 1**:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Output 1**:
```javascript
"Sum is: 15"
```

**Input 2**:
```javascript
[1, "abc", 3, 4, "xyz", 5]
```

**Output 2**:
```javascript
"Sum is: 13"
```

**Input 3**:
```javascript
[]
```

**Output 3**:
```javascript
"Empty array"
```
